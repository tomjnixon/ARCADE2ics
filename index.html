<h1>ARCADE2ics</h1>

<p>ARCADE2ics converts ARCADE emails into iCalendar files that can be imported into
Google calendar, your phone, or almost any other piece of calendar software.</p>

<p>By default, ARCADE2ics puts your timetable on-line, and updates automatically,
allowing you to 'subscribe' to the timetable, meaning that you will always
have the latest version available. </p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<pre><code>  $ git clone git://github.com/tomjnixon/ARCADE2ics.git
  $ ./ARCADE2ics/run
</code></pre>

<p>You should be presented with some configuration options. These are explained below:</p>

<h3>Input Method</h3>

<p>Chose where ARCADE2ics gets its data from. Highlight any that you want and press "space" to select. You should probably chose <code>arcade.direct</code> or <code>arcade.email</code>.</p>

<h3>Auto Update</h3>

<p>If selected, ARCADE2ics will update before it's running, so you'll always be running the latest version with the latest fixes and features.</p>

<h3>Send Timetable</h3>

<p>This option is currently unused, but will soon cause ARCADE2ics to send me a copy of your ARCADE timetable so that I can verify that it's all working properly. You'll probably be making your timetable publicly accessible anyway, so you might as well select this.</p>

<h3>Cron</h3>

<p>Select this to install to the crontab on this computer. This will make ARCADE2ics run automatically between 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
<li>The default iCalendar location is <code>~/public_html/timetable.ics</code></li>
<li>This can be accessed at <a href="http://www2.cs.man.ac.uk/~user_name/timetable.ics">http://www2.cs.man.ac.uk/~user_name/timetable.ics</a></li>
<li>If using Google calendar, this address will not work (due to robots.txt).
You may use <a href="http://tnutils.appspot.com/timetable-user_name.ics">http://tnutils.appspot.com/timetable-user_name.ics</a> instead.</li>
<li>To manually re-generate the timetable, run <code>run</code>.</li>
<li>To change the names of modules in the calendar, edit <code>~/.unit_titles</code>. This is in the form of a python dictionary, and should be fairly self-explanatory.</li>
</ul>
